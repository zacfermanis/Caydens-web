# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Basic FPS movement and controls
- Grid-based world rendering
- First-person camera system

## Recent Changes
1. Swapped W/S key directions for movement
2. Implemented ground-based movement
3. Added grid floor rendering
4. Set up first-person camera controls

## Active Decisions
1. **Movement System**
   - Ground-based movement only
   - Fixed vertical position
   - WASD controls with inverted W/S
   - Mouse look controls

2. **Camera System**
   - First-person perspective
   - Clamped pitch rotation
   - Normalized view vectors
   - Fixed eye level

3. **World System**
   - Grid-based floor
   - Dark gray grid lines
   - Fixed grid size
   - Limited world size

## Current Implementation
- Basic FPS engine structure
- Vector3 mathematics
- Camera controls
- Grid rendering
- Player movement

## Next Steps
1. Test and refine movement controls
2. Optimize grid rendering
3. Add basic collision detection
4. Implement additional features

## Active Patterns
1. **Movement Pattern**
   - Ground-based movement
   - Camera-relative direction
   - Normalized vectors

2. **Rendering Pattern**
   - 2D projection
   - Depth-based rendering
   - Grid-based world

3. **Control Pattern**
   - WASD movement
   - Mouse look
   - Inverted W/S

## Current Considerations
1. Movement smoothness
2. Control responsiveness
3. Grid rendering performance
4. Camera behavior

## Recent Learnings
1. Vector normalization importance
2. Camera-relative movement
3. Grid rendering optimization
4. Control scheme design
