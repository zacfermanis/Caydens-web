   - Obstacles spawn from top and fall down
   - Clear visual progression from bottom to top

2. Death and Respawn
   - Single automatic restart on death
   - Full health restoration
   - Spawn at first platform
   - Clear death screen feedback

3. Screen Scrolling
   - 10-screen vertical progression
   - Smooth camera transitions
   - Win condition at top of last screen
   - Screen counter for progress tracking

4. UI Design
   - Fixed stamina display
   - Dynamic charge indicator
   - Clear health feedback
   - Informative death screen

5. Movement Mechanics
   - Maintaining separate horizontal and vertical controls
   - Preserving momentum during jumps
   - Using different speeds for ground and air movement
