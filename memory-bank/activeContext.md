   - Increased platform count and spacing

2. Health System Implementation
   - Added player health (100 max)
   - Health bar display with visual feedback
   - Obstacle collision damage (20 damage per hit)
   - Death and respawn mechanics

3. Movement System Enhancements
   - Independent horizontal and vertical movement
   - Improved air control
   - Better momentum preservation
   - Smoother jumping while moving

4. Level Generation Improvements
   - Zigzag platform pattern
   - Strategic platform placement
   - Progressive difficulty scaling
   - Better spacing for jumps

## Active Decisions
1. Movement Mechanics
   - Maintaining separate horizontal and vertical controls
   - Preserving momentum during jumps
   - Using different speeds for ground and air movement
   - Implementing air resistance for better control

2. Health System
   - Using a simple health bar display

2. Feature Implementation
   - Consider adding health pickups
   - Implement power-ups
   - Add visual effects for damage
   - Create more varied obstacles

3. Level Design
   - Create more varied platform patterns
   - Add environmental hazards
   - Implement checkpoints
   - Design boss levels

## Current Challenges
1. Balancing difficulty progression
2. Ensuring smooth movement controls
3. Creating engaging level layouts
4. Managing health system balance
