# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Platformer game with space debris theme
- Player movement and jumping mechanics
- Stamina system implementation
- Win condition at level top

## Recent Changes
- Implemented stamina system with visual bar
- Modified W key to only boost jumps (not independent movement)
- Added ground detection for reliable jumping
- Fixed multiple jump functionality
- Added debug information display

## Next Steps
1. Test and balance stamina system
2. Adjust platform generation for better gameplay
3. Polish win condition mechanics
4. Add visual feedback for actions

## Active Decisions
- Using LÃ–VE framework with Lua
- Component-based architecture
- Physics-based movement system
- Stamina-based jump mechanics
- Space debris visual theme

## Important Patterns
- Documentation-first approach
- Component-based design
- State management
- Physics-based movement
- Stamina management

## Project Insights
- Game focuses on vertical platforming
- Physics and collision are critical
- Player controls need to be responsive
- Stamina adds strategic depth
- Ground detection is essential for reliable jumping

## Notes
The project is in active development with core mechanics implemented. Current focus is on balancing and polishing the gameplay experience.
