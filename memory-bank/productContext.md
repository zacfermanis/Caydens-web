# Product Context

## Problem Statement
Game development often requires complex engines that can be overwhelming for beginners or too heavy for simple projects. There's a need for a lightweight, extensible FPS game engine that provides core functionality without unnecessary complexity.

## Solution
This Lua FPS Game Engine provides:
1. A simple but powerful foundation for FPS game development
2. Clear, modular architecture for easy extension
3. Essential FPS mechanics out of the box
4. Minimal dependencies (just Lua and LÃ–VE)

## User Experience Goals
1. **Developers**
   - Easy to understand and modify codebase
   - Clear documentation for extending functionality
   - Minimal boilerplate for new features
   - Intuitive API for common game mechanics

2. **End Users**
   - Smooth player movement and controls
   - Responsive shooting mechanics
   - Consistent performance
   - Intuitive gameplay

## How It Works
The engine is built on a modular architecture:
1. Core engine (`engine.lua`) handles:
   - Vector mathematics
   - Entity management
   - Collision detection
   - Ray casting

2. Game implementation (`game.lua`) demonstrates:
   - Player controls
   - Basic shooting
   - Entity interaction

## Key Features
1. **Movement System**
   - WASD controls
   - Mouse look
   - Smooth camera movement

2. **Combat System**
   - Ray casting for shooting
   - Basic damage system
   - Weapon management

3. **Entity System**
   - Extensible entity framework
   - Collision detection
   - Update/draw cycles

## Future Considerations
1. Performance optimization
2. Additional weapon types
3. More complex entity behaviors
4. Enhanced collision detection
5. Better visual feedback
