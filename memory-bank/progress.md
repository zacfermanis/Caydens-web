# Progress

## What Works
- Basic game structure and architecture
- Player movement (A/D for horizontal, S for down)
- Jumping mechanics (spacebar)
- Boosted jumps (W + spacebar)
- Stamina system with visual bar
- Platform generation
- Win condition at level top
- Ground detection
- Multiple jump functionality
- Debug information display

## What's Left to Build
1. Game Balance
   - Fine-tune stamina costs and regeneration
   - Adjust platform generation
   - Balance jump heights and speeds

2. Visual Polish
   - Add visual feedback for actions
   - Improve platform appearance
   - Add particle effects
   - Enhance win condition visuals

3. Game Features
   - Level progression system
   - Score system
   - Sound effects
   - Menu system

## Current Status
- Core mechanics implemented
- Basic gameplay loop functional
- Stamina system operational
- Win condition working
- Debug features in place

## Known Issues
- Need to balance stamina system
- Platform generation could be more strategic
- Visual feedback could be improved
- Win condition could be more polished

## Project Evolution
- Initial concept defined
- Core mechanics implemented
- Stamina system added
- Movement system refined
- Ground detection implemented

## Notes
The game is in a playable state with all core mechanics implemented. Current focus is on balancing and polishing the gameplay experience.
