# Project Brief: Lua FPS Game Engine

## Project Overview
A simple but extensible First-Person Shooter game engine written in Lua, using the LÖVE framework. The engine provides core functionality for 3D vector mathematics, player movement, camera controls, and a grid-based world.

## Core Requirements
1. 3D Vector Mathematics System
2. Player Movement and Camera Controls
3. Grid-based World Rendering
4. First-Person Camera System

## Technical Requirements
- Lua 5.1 or later
- LÖVE framework

## Project Goals
1. Create a lightweight, extensible FPS game engine
2. Provide clear documentation for extending the engine
3. Implement core FPS mechanics in a modular way
4. Enable easy addition of new features and entities

## Project Scope
### In Scope
- Core engine functionality
- Basic FPS mechanics
- Grid-based world
- Vector mathematics
- Camera controls
- Player movement

### Out of Scope
- Advanced graphics features
- Networking capabilities
- Physics simulation
- Sound system
- UI framework

## Success Criteria
1. Engine runs smoothly with basic FPS mechanics
2. Player movement and camera controls work intuitively
3. Grid world renders correctly
4. Documentation is clear and comprehensive
5. Code is modular and maintainable
