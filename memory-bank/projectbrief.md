# Project Brief: Cayden's Web

## Overview
This project is a 2D platformer game where the player's goal is to climb to the top of the level while avoiding obstacles. The game is being developed using the LÖVE (Love2D) framework and Lua programming language.

## Core Requirements
- 2D platformer gameplay mechanics
- Player movement using WASD keys
- Jumping mechanics using spacebar
- Level design with obstacles
- Win condition: reaching the top of the level
- Collision detection for obstacles
- Player physics and movement controls

## Project Goals
- Create an engaging platformer experience
- Implement smooth player controls
- Design challenging but fair levels
- Ensure responsive gameplay
- Create an intuitive user interface

## Scope
- Single-player game
- 2D graphics and physics
- Keyboard-based controls
- Level-based progression
- Obstacle avoidance mechanics

## Success Criteria
- Smooth and responsive player controls
- Engaging level design
- Clear win conditions
- Proper collision detection
- Stable performance
- Intuitive gameplay

## Timeline
- Project Start: [Current Date]
- Key Milestones:
  - Basic player movement implementation
  - Level design and obstacles
  - Collision detection
  - Win condition implementation
  - Polish and optimization

## Stakeholders
- Primary: Cayden
- Development Team: To be determined

## Notes
This project will focus on creating a fun and challenging platformer using the LÖVE framework and Lua programming language.
